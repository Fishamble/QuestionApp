# Coding questions
This app poses coding questions, and reveals the answer when clicked. Subjects are divided by tags.
The questions and answers are from notes I took while studying, so there may be inaccuracies.

This was my first project to include a back-end, so my main goal was to utilise firebase API to store the answers on firestore.

Please try out the [project here](https://jsqapp.netlify.app/) - hosted on netlify.
